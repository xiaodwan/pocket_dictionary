Quiz Example (test)
The test command is the best way to practice.
Run the command:
python main.py test


The program will display a definition. Type the word you think it is and press ENTER.
The program will tell you if you were correct and then present the next definition.
To end the quiz, press Ctrl+C. You will see a summary of your performance.
How It Works
The program automatically creates a hidden directory in your user home folder (~/.pocket_dictionary/) to store your data:
word.txt: A simple text file containing your list of saved words, one per line.
weights.json: A file that stores your quiz progress. It tracks how often you get each word right or wrong, ensuring that words you find difficult appear more frequently in the test quiz.
